TODO:
Fix Leaderboard Database
    make formatting better
    sort by score
    display only top 10
    dont allow blank name
    only allow user to submit score if it was higher than their last submission (will require a system to track users)
    update score field with cookie when page loads (should be easy, I just forgot before I pushed)
Replace DOM manipulation with JQuery (sorry i forgot)
COMMENT CODE (Ughhhh i keep forgetting)
Clean up javascript + better formatting
Create cookie system to keep track of users submitting to leaderboard
MAKE THE SITE LOOK LESS SHITTY (the first thing i did was install bootstrap but i haven't even used it lol)

\*\*LATER\*\*
